# MTA-dev-utils
Some MTA development utilizations packed up in a resource. Contributions are welcome!

##Example:
Use `import` function exported from this resource in a startup script in your resource and then you can use related functionality.
```lua
loadstring(exports["MTA-dev-utils"]:import("class"))()
```

TOOD: Add some more example per module
